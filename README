This is a collection of all the compilation tools necessary to
compile ISO C and C++ programs, except hardware drivers and
initialization routines, for the CRIS architecture (ETRAX
chips), and to make pure binary files of the linked output.

To configure, compile and install:
./install-cris-tools [install-dir [man-dir [info-dir [temp-dir] ["/" [tooltuples]]]]

The install script will ask a couple of questions regarding
installation directories, test for file access permissions, and test
for presence of a previous installation.  You have to have write
permissions in these directories, of course.  You may specify
/dev/null for man-dir or info-dir if you do not want documentation.
No space characters are allowed in any of the argument paths,
the path to install-cris-tools and the current directory; "cwd",
"pwd".

Different compiler parts (including header files) will be installed in
various sub-directories under install-dir.  The compiler tools will be
installed in install-dir/bin, with some compatibility scripts and
links in install-dir.  Temporary files such as object files will be
located in temp-dir; it defaults to "./tmpdir".

The "/" argument is a placeholder for a future
installation-prefix (used with packaging, not an end-user
feature), which currently does not work due to not being
supported in this version of gcc.  It must currently be
specified as "" (an empty argument) or "/".

The "tooltuples" argument allow for installation of a subset of
the possible compiler-tools variants, represented by their GNU
target tuple: cris-axis-linux-gnu crisv32-axis-elf etc.  Use
commas and/or space to make a list.  The default is all:
cris-axis-elf, cris-axis-linux-gnu, crisv32-axis-elf and
crisv32-axis-linux-gnu

If you're opposed to executing unknown shell scripts, you're welcome
to look in the install-cris-tools shell script and execute the steps
manually.  Beware, this is error-prone and tedious.  The shell script
is provided as a convenience: it checks details that must not be
forgotten and produces a log to include in an email in case things go
wrong.

There is also a cris-dist.spec, corresponding to what is used in RPM:s
distributed at <ftp://ftp.axis.se/pub/axis/tools/cris/compiler-kit/>.

If you encounter problems, or have questions regarding these tools, email
<compiler-contact@axis.com>.  But before that, please look at the
error-message in the log for locally induced failures, such as "disk
full".
 Please also note that some NFS configurations (between SUN/Solaris and
Linux) have problems, showing behavior similar to fluky hardware.  For
information about diagnosing fluky hardware, see

Relation between this and the closest publicly available sources:

- cris-dist-N.M/binutils directory: Latest import is from FSF
  binutils 2.12.1.  See <URL:http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/>.
  Testsuites for architectures other than CRIS may be omitted.
  Axis-specific changes are entered into ChangeLog files named
  ChangeLog.Axis.

- cris-dist-N.M/gnu-toplev/newlib and cris-dist-N.M/gnu-toplev/libgloss
  directories: Latest import is the CVS version of 2000-04-27 23:30
  CET (see <URL:http://sourceware.cygnus.com/newlib/>): date tag
  "-D 2000-04-27 23:30 CET".  Changes are logged in files named
  ChangeLog.Axis.  The "cris" directories are new.

- The rest of cris-dist-N.M/gnu-toplev comes from FSF gcc 3.2.1.
  Changes are logged in files named ChangeLog.Axis.  Many large
  directories and files not necessary for installation are not
  included (for example, most testsuites, unsupported languages and
  their libraries).


Some compilation and installation figures for the tuples
"cris-axis-elf, cris-axis-linux-gnu":
 3 hours  2xPII 512M 350MHz, GNU/Linux-2.2.17, local 10K RPM disks.
 1 hour   AMD Athlon 384M 1GHz, GNU/Linux 2.2.17, local 7200 RPM disks.
 20 min   AMD Opteron 254 2.8GHz with (i686) GNU/Linux 2.6.8, NFS source, local 7200 RPM disks.

For a full installation, of
"crisv32-axis-linux-gnu, cris-axis-linux-gnu, crisv32-axis-elf, cris-axis-elf":
 27 min   AMD Opteron 254 2.8 GHz with (i686) GNU/Linux 2.6.8, NFS source, to local 7200 RPM disks.
 40 min   AMD Opteron 150 2.4 GHz with (x86_64) GNU/Linux 2.6.8, NFS source, to local 7200 RPM disks.

Disk needs, approximately, for a supposedly typically configured x86
or x86_64 GNU/Linux system, with installation of glibc:
  260M Compiler libraries, tool binaries, header files.
    6M Info and manual-pages
 1300M Temporaries

Note that GNU make is required.  Additionally, if glibc is included, a
GNU host system such as GNU/Linux is required.
