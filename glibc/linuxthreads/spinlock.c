/* The status field of a spinlock is a pointer whose least significant
   bit is a locked flag.

   Thus the field values have the following meanings:

   status == 0:       spinlock is free
   status == 1:       spinlock is taken; no thread is waiting on it

   (status & 1) == 1: spinlock is taken and (status & ~1L) is a
                      pointer to the first waiting thread; other
		      waiting threads are linked via the p_nextlock
		      field.
   (status & 1) == 0: same as above, but spinlock is not taken.

   The waiting list is not sorted by priority order.
   Actually, we always insert at top of list (sole insertion mode
   that can be performed without locking).
   For __pthread_unlock, we perform a linear search in the list
   to find the highest-priority, oldest waiting thread.
   This is safe because there are no concurrent __pthread_unlock
   operations -- only the thread that locked the mutex can unlock it. */
