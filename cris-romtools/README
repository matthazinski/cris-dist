This is a rudimentary collection of tools for modifying the linked
"executable" in a.out-cris little endian format.

For producing ROMmable binary files, I recommend using the
binutils "objcopy" program.  It can be used if you need to
generate S1-record format output.  However, it has a bug when
using the "-i" option, which is worked around in the bin-cris.sh
shell-script.  The script takes slightly different options in
order to be compatible with an old program compatible with an
even older program.  The script is installed as bin-cris and
cris-burn.

There is a linker-modifier script called ldur-cris, which does nothing
but passing through everything to the real linker, unless the switches
"-Ur -d" are given; it then makes adjustments to the relocations to make
sure no symbols are needed.  This is for the MMU-less version of linux,
"elinux"; derived from uClinux (somewhat outdated info about that project
at <URL:http://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/uClinux/>).  The program ldur-cris is
installed as the linker, but only on systems with perl version 5.  This
does not matter if you have no need to support the elinux compilation
environment.  This program has grown to incorporate a few other
uses which should be of no interest to the wider public.

There are also wrapper programs called nm-wrap and strip-wrap,
to handle specific situations with usage of the binutils program
nm and strip.
